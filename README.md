## <v></v> <div align="left"> Impoting Dataset: <div/> 
To import a dataset into a SQL database, you can use SQL's built-in tools such as LOAD DATA INFILE in MySQL or COPY in PostgreSQL to directly import CSV or text files. Alternatively, I could have used SQL client tools with import functionalities, programming languages like Python to write scripts for data insertion for more complex tasks.

To query tasks in SQL, I used the SELECT statement followed by the columns I want to retrieve, specifying the table name with FROM. For instance, SELECT * FROM tasks; fetches all tasks from a table named "tasks". To filter results, I use the WHERE clause, like SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE status = 'completed'; to fetch completed tasks.
Most common statements are:
